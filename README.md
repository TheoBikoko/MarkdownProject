The use of git for this project is allowing me to:

- Be able to _document and review_ the evolution of this project
- **Roll back to the previous commit** if something unexpected happens, this feature is possible thanks to the following command: `git reset --soft HEAD~1`
- > "Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, itâ€™s bad." - Cory House
